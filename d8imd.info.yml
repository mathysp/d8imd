# package: <name>
#> Specifies a "package" that allows you to group themes together.

# php: 7.0.2
#> The minimum version of PHP required. Defaults to value of DRUPAL_MINIMUM_PHP constant.

# version: 8.x-1.0
#> Specifies a version. For themes hosted on drupal.org, the version number will be filled in by the packaging script. Do not specify it manually, but leave out the version line entirely.

# libraries-override
#> A collection of libraries and assets to override. Read more at Overriding and extending libraries: https://www.drupal.org/node/2216195#override-extend

# hidden: true
#> Indicates whether or not to hide the theme from the "Appearance" page so that it cannot be enabled/disabled via the UI.

# engine: twig
#> The theme engine. Defaults to "twig".

# screenshot: fluffiness.png
#> The path to screenshot relative to the theme's .info.yml file. Screenshots should be 588 pixels wide and 438 pixels high, though they are displayed at a smaller size. By default, Drupal will look for a file named "screenshot.png" in the root of your theme folder and use that as the theme image on the "Appearance" page.

# regions_hidden: -sidebar_last
#> A list of inherited regions to remove.

# features: -favicon
#> A list of features to expose on the theme "Settings" page.

##################################

# stylesheets
#> A list of stylesheets to add to all pages where the theme is active.

# stylesheets-remove:
#> A list of stylesheets from other modules or themes to remove from all pages where the theme is active. Each value must be a full path relative to the docroot to resolve ambiguity when more than one file with the same name exists. In cases where the file is part of a library that belongs to a module or theme, a token in the form @module_or_theme_name can be used in place of the full path. Note that when using the token the value must be quoted because "@" is a reserved indicator in YAML. Note: This key is deprecated and will be removed in Drupal 9. In most cases libraries-override should be used.

# scripts
#> A list of theme scripts to add to all pages where the theme is active.
